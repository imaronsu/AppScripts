AppScripts
==========

This repo contains simple scripts that I have created or found on the web. It is a collection of scripts that make my life easier on the Macbook Pro. I have organized those scripts into folders. Since this scripts could be used with the AppleScript Editor, I usually put the scripts in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/. Scripts can also be activiated by special-assigned keypress. I use BetterTouchTool to map keys to scripts.
